Certainly! Let's elaborate on each section of the presentation with more details related to the provided code.

Presentation: Movie Rental Store

Slide 1: Introduction

Purpose of the Presentation: The purpose of this presentation is to introduce our Movie Rental Store application and highlight its key features and functionalities. We will showcase the implementation of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design to manage movies, customers, and rentals efficiently.

Description of the Problem and the Movie Rental Store Process: In today's fast-paced world, movie rental stores still play a significant role in providing entertainment to customers. Our Movie Rental Store aims to bridge the gap between traditional movie rental businesses and modern technology. We will demonstrate how our application allows customers to browse, rent, and return movies seamlessly, and how the store can efficiently manage its movie catalog and customer data.

Slide 2: Explanation of Classes - OOP Classes Used

In this section, we will delve into the three primary classes used in our application:

Movie Class: This class represents a movie available in our rental store. It has attributes such as Title, Rating, Genre, Year, Price, Tag, Description, MovieId, and Ratings. It also includes methods to retrieve movie details and the movie's price.

Customer Class: The Customer class represents a customer of our rental store. It has attributes like FirstName, LastName, Age, Gender, Phone, CustomerId, MoviePreferences, and ShoppingCart. The class includes methods to manage movie preferences, get customer details, and add movies to the shopping cart.

RentalStore Class: This class serves as the core of our movie rental store. It manages and stores information about movies, customers, and rentals. Key methods include addToStore, removeFromStore, addCustomer, removeCustomer, rentMovie, returnMovie, and several utility functions for displaying movies and customers.

Slide 3: Functionality of the Code

Here, we will explain the key functionalities of our Movie Rental Store code:

Adding and Removing Movies and Customers: The RentalStore class provides methods to add and remove movies and customers from the store. We can use the addToStore and removeFromStore methods to manage the movie inventory. Similarly, the addCustomer and removeCustomer methods handle customer management.

Renting Movies: When a customer wishes to rent a movie, the rentMovie method is used to create a rental record with details such as the movie, customer ID, rental price, and duration. This rental record is added to the RentalsDict.

Returning Movies: The returnMovie method handles the return of a movie by a customer. It verifies the movie's existence in the rental records and marks it as returned.

Slide 4: Code Metrics and What Makes Our Code the Best

In this section, we will discuss the code's strengths and why it is designed effectively:

Object-Oriented Design (OOP): Our code is structured around OOP principles, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability. The classes and methods follow a clear hierarchy and encapsulate data and functionality.

Efficient Data Management: The code efficiently manages movies, customers, and rentals using data structures like lists and dictionaries. This allows for fast retrieval and manipulation of information.

Code Reusability: The use of classes and methods promotes code reusability. For example, the Movie and Customer classes can be easily extended to add new attributes or methods as needed.

Slide 5: Future Developments of the Project

In this final section, we will explore potential future developments for our Movie Rental Store:

User Interface Enhancement: Developing a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) can enhance the user experience and attract a broader customer base.

Payment Integration: Implementing secure payment options would make the rental process more convenient for customers.

Search and Recommendation Engine: Incorporating search and recommendation algorithms would help customers
